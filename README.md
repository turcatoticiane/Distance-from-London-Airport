# Distance from London Heathrow Airport

In this project, I used the potcode.io API and constructed a middle API in Java to handle the information
and pass it on to just what would be interesting that the client receives.

For the <strong>back-end</strong>, the language is Java using Spring Boot, in an MVC structure and service handle with information.

For the <strong>front-end</strong> Angular was the choice, using HTML, SCSS, and Typescript. It is a two pages application 
because the idea was to have the three last search information but in a separate part.
